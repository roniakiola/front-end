Front end code of my Full Stack REST API school project

In this project we designed and built a mobile responsive REST API based web application from scratch including front end, back end and relation database. As our project we chose to make a forum like image board where students of Metropolia can create personal accounts and make forum posts that other users can respond to. Forum posts can include text and images.

Currently this website is inaccessible for public due to it being hosted on Metropolia's virtual computer which requires user to be in Metropolia network (locally or via VPN). This project will become visible in the future as I continue to advance it as my personal project for learning.
